# FileHelper
Now this is an application that allows you to manage image files using from descriptions and keywords from exif. The application is only for windows, because to get the exif data I use   
<a href="https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/" target="_blank">ExifTool</a>.
So this application must be installed on your system.
